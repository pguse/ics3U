# Lists

Lists are a data structure that allow you to store multiple values using one assigned name.  Read this [note](https://github.com/pguse/ics3u/tree/master/notes/08%20-%20Lists) for an introduction to lists.

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, complete the following programs.

## 07-0: Even Elements
Create a file called **evenElements.py**. Write a program with the following specifications:
Given a list of numbers, find and print all elements that are an even number. In this case use a for-loop that iterates over the list, and not over its indices! That is, don't use range().

## 07-1: Greater than Previous
Create a file called **greaterThanPrevious.py**. Write a program with the following specifications:
Given a list of numbers, find and print all the elements that are greater than the previous element.

## 07-2: Neighbours of the Same Sign
Create a file called **neighboursSameSign.py**. Write a program with the following specifications:
Given a list of numbers, find and print the first adjacent elements which have the same sign. If there is no such pair, leave the output blank.

## 07-3: The Number of Distinct Elements
Create a file called **numDistinctElements.py**. Write a program with the following specifications:
Given a list of numbers with all of its elements sorted in ascending order, determine and print the quantity of distinct elements in it.

## 07-4: Swap Neighbours
Create a file called **swapNeighbours.py**. Write a program with the following specifications:
Given a list of numbers, swap adjacent items in pairs (A[0] with A[1], A[2] with A[3], etc.). Print the resulting list. If a list has an odd number of elements, leave the last element in place.
