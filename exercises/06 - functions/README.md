# Functions

Unlike the functions created in the Turtle exercises, all of these functions have a **return** value similar to functions that you deal with in your math class.  Unlike your math class, these functions can have multiple inputs ***(parameters)*** , separated by commas.

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, create a file called ***functionsExercises.py*** .  Within this file,

* create all the functions described below
* use each function to perform a **calculation** and **output** the result.  You should have 5 print() statements that implement each function.

## 05-0: Area of a Circle
Write a function called ***circle_area(radius)*** that calculates and outputs the area of a circle, given its **radius**.

## 05-1: Hypotenuse
Write a function called ***hypotenuse(a,b)*** that calculates and returns the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides **a** and **b**.

## 05-2: Slope
Write a function called ***slope(x1,y1,x2,y2)*** that calculates and returns the slope of a line passing through the points **(x1,y1)** and **(x2,y2)**.

## 05-3: Distance
Write a function called ***distance(x1,y1,x2,y2)*** that calculates and returns the distance between the points **(x1,y1)** and **(x2,y2)**.

## 05-4: Reverse
Write a function called ***reverse(text)*** , that takes in a string called **text** and returns the characters in reverse order. This is a simple way to encode a message.
