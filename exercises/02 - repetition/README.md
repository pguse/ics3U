# Repetition

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, complete the following programs.

## 02-0: Count to 10
Create a file called **count_to_n.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications: **Input:**  A positive integer N, **Output:** print all the numbers from 1 to N, on a single horizontal line, with a single space between each pair of numbers.

### For Example:

```
Positive Integer: 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

## 02-1: Descending Even Numbers
Create a file called **even_numbers_descending.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications:  **Input:**  A positive integer N, **Output:**  print all the even numbers from 0 to N in descending order, with each number on its own line

### For Example:

```
Positive Integer: 7
6
4
2
0
```

```
Positive Integer: 4
4
2
0
```

## 02-2: Product of Numbers
Create a file called **product_of_numbers.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications:    **Input:**  The first line of input contains a positive integer N: the number of integers to follow. Each of the next N lines contains one integer. **Output:**  print the product of these N integers

### For Example:

```
Number of integers to follow:  3
4
-3
2
Product: -24
```

## 02-3: Is it Prime?
Create a file called **is_prime.py**.  A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  Create a program with the following specifications:  **Input:**   Given an integer N > 1,  **Output:**  print PRIME if it's prime and print COMPOSITE otherwise.

### For Example:

```
Integer (>1): 8
COMPOSITE
```

```
Integer (>1): 13
PRIME
```
