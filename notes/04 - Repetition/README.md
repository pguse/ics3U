# Repetition

## The for-loop:

This type of loop is useful when you know how many times to repeat your instructions. For example.

```
for i in range(3):
    print “Hello everyone!”
print “Loop finished.”
```

produces the output:

```
Hello everyone!
Hello everyone!
Hello everyone!
Loop finished
```

The function **range**\(3\) causes the loop to repeat 3 times. Changing it to **range**\(5\) would repeat the loop 5 times. The variable **i** takes on the values 0, 1, and 2 during each repetition of the loop. For example,

```
for i in range(3):
    print str(i) +“. Hello everyone!”
```

produces the output:

```
0. Hello everyone!
1. Hello everyone!
2. Hello everyone!
```

The variable **i** can be used as a type of counter in the following way:

```
count = 0
for i in range(3):
    count = count + i
    print count, i
```

produces the output:

```
0 0
1 1
3 2
```

The **range**\(3\) function can be modified in the following ways:

```
for i in range(1,4):
    print str(i) +“. Hello everyone!”
```

produces the output:

```
1. Hello everyone!
2. Hello everyone!
3. Hello everyone!
```

Notice how the variable **i** now starts at a value of 1 but only goes up to the maximum value \(in this case 4\) but does not take on a value of 4. Also,

```
for i in range(1,7,2):
    print str(i) +“. Hello everyone!”
```

produces the output:

```
1. Hello everyone!
3. Hello everyone!
5. Hello everyone!
```

In this case, the variable **i** takes on values in steps of 2. We can also count backwards by doing the following:

```
for i in range(4,1,-1):
    print str(i) +“. Hello everyone!”
```

produces the output:

```
4. Hello everyone!
3. Hello everyone!
2. Hello everyone!
```

Again, the variable **i** does not take on the minimum value of 1, but only goes down to it.

## The for-loop - without the range\(\) function:

The **for-loop** can be used without the **range**\(\) function in a couple ways. It can be used to pass through the characters in a string as follows:

```
name =“Ada”
for ch in name:
    print( ch )
```

produces the output:

```
A
d
a
```

It can also be used to pass through the items in a **list** as follows:

```
names = [“Ada”, “Python”, “Pyret”]
for language in names:
    print language
```

produces the output:

```
Ada
Python
Pyret
```

## The while-loop:

The **while-loop** is used when you don't know the exact number of times that a loop needs to repeat.  It only repeats as long as a given condition is true.  Here is an example, where the loop will end only when the user enters a negative value.

```
n = 1
while n > 0:
  n = input("Enter a number: ")
```

Here is an example of a **while-loop** that will end when the user enters a 'secret' number.

```
secret = 42
guess = -1
while guess != secret:
    guess = int( input("Guess the secret number: ") )
```

You can write a **while-loop** to repeat a fixed number of times by using an **accumulator** variable \(counter\).  This is similar to how a **for-loop** works.

```
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    print("Hello")
    counter = counter + 1
```

This code will produce the following output.

```
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
