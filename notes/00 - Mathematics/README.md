# Mathematics in Python

## Types of Numbers

We're going to look at two types of numbers that we many encounter this year using Python:  integer, and floating-point values.  Notice below that we can use the **_type()_** function to indicate the data type of the given values.

```python
>>> type(5)
<class 'int'>
```

```python
>>> type(3.0)
<class 'float'>
```

### Operations

Look at how the results of addition and subtraction operations compare when using different types of numbers.

```python
>>> 7 - 10
-3
>>> 5.0 + 1.3
6.3
>>> 6.5 - 4
2.5
>>> 5 / 3
1.6666666666666667
>>> 2**3
8
>>> 7 - 10 + 5*2**3
37
```

##### Integer Division
Sometimes you only want to calculate the integer part of a division operation.  You accomplish this by using the integer division operator **//**.

```python
>>> 5 // 3
1
```

##### Modulus _(Remainder)_
The modulus or remainder operator calculates the remainder of a division operation.  So, **a % b** calculates the remainder of **a / b**.

```python
>>> 5 % 3
2
```
